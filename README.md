## Introduction

This is a python package that deploys a command line tool to monitor
Ableton Live clips through [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC) and
[pylive](https://github.com/ideoforms/pylive). When a clip finishes playing,
this utility can change the color to visually flag the clip as having been
played. When the global playback is stopped, the utility will reset all of the
clips to the color they had before it changed them.
